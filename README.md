## 📝 Problem Statement
Accurate rainfall prediction is one of the most critical challenges in weather forecasting.  
Traditional methods often fail to capture localized and seasonal variations in rainfall patterns.  

This project aims to:
- Predict rainfall in major Indian cities for the next **7 days** using Machine Learning.  
- Explore **seasonal patterns** and **trends** in rainfall data.  
- Build and evaluate regression models for short-term rainfall forecasting.
